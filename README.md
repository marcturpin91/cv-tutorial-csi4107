# Basics of Computer Vision 
### An interactive tutorial using OpenCV

Tutorial Written by Marc Turpin on December 3rd, 2018

## Context

This project was done as an end of semester project for the Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CSI4107) class at the University of Ottawa, fall 2018 semester. I chose to create an interactive tutorial that would not only introduce the basics of computer vision, but allow readers to experiment with the popular OpenCV library. This approach aimed to solidify the learning experience by immediately showing how computer vision concepts translate to real world application. 
There were a couple of key points that motivated me to choose this topic and complete my project. Here are some of them:

•	Learn about image (pre)processing

•	Learn about computer vision

•	Learn how to use OpenCV

•	Gain experience using Jupyter Notebooks

•	Transfer that knowledge in an intuitive way to students


The choice of working with OpenCV for this tutorial was an easy one. It is one of the most known and utilized libraries for computer vision. The goal wasn’t necessarily to create an innovative tutorial, since there are a lot of resources online on this library, but to take a different approach and to transfer the knowledge from someone who was in the middle of the learning process.


## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is curious people who have a basic understanding of programming and are looking for an introduction to computer vision. 


## Installation and Running Instructions

The Jupyter Notebook that contains all my work (the tutorial) is provided in my zip file submission. Here are the things that I have used for the tutorial:

•	Anaconda distribution (includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)

•	Python 3.6.3

•	OpenCV-python 3.4.3.18

•	Jupyter

•	Numpy 1.15.4

•	Windows 10

In the notebook, I repeated many steps throughout in order to make each module (cell) work on its own. Users can freely jump around and are not required to go about in a linear fashion when running the individual cells.


## Conclusion

This project took a big chunk of my time during the end of school semester. I know it is not perfect, but I am happy with the knowledge that I have gained and the work I have put in. I tried to explain things intuitively with appropriate examples before diving into the OpenCV functions, as to allow readers to understand what is going on behind the scenes and how to use the parameters for the library’s functions. That was something I had notice when learning about image processing and computer vision. A lot of tutorials either talk about the technical/mathematical concepts but don’t show the OpenCV implementation, or they do the opposite. Not a lot of tutorials show a good mix of both. I had to do a lot of research to figure out how the parameters worked for a lot of the OpenCV functions. I am hoping I cleared most of that up in my tutorial.

I believe I have achieved the goals I originally set out. If I had to change one thing, I would have tried to find even more time in order to further clarify some of the concepts. I’m looking forward to exploring this field more in the near future, and I’m hoping my tutorial motivates others to do so as well.
